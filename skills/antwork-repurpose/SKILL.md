description: Use when the user wants to turn ONE piece of source content into platform-native posts through Antwork — a blog post, newsletter, long LinkedIn post, podcast/video transcript, or talk reshaped into versions for each platform. Trigger on phrases like "repurpose this", "turn this blog into posts", "make this into a LinkedIn + X + Threads version", "atomize this content", "spin this into social", or pasting long-form content and asking to distribute it.

# Repurposing one piece into platform-native posts

Antwork binds each post to a single account, and platform is derived from that account. Repurposing means writing a *distinct, native* version per platform — never one body copy-pasted everywhere — and grouping them as one campaign. This workflow codifies the mistakes assistants make when atomizing content.

## 1. Anchor the source

Identify the one source piece and its core idea. If the user hasn't pasted it, ask for the text, URL, or transcript. Extract the spine before reshaping:

- The single biggest claim or takeaway.
- 3–5 supporting points or moments that can each stand alone.
- Any quotable line, stat, or hook.

This spine is what gets reshaped per platform — not the prose itself.

## 2. Pick targets and pull each voice

Confirm which accounts to publish to (`list_social_accounts` if unsure — note `account_id`, platform, token health). For **each** target platform, before writing:

- `get_post_context(account_ids=[...])` — brand plus each account's recent posts, which are its voice. Each account has its own; LinkedIn-you and X-you are not the same writer.

## 3. Reshape — do not reuse

Write a **native variant per platform**. Reusing one body across platforms is the core failure: X's 280-char cap mangles LinkedIn prose, and LinkedIn-length paragraphs look broken on Threads. Reshape for each:

- **X (280)** — the sharpest single claim, or a thread broken into beats. No fluff.
- **Threads (500)** — conversational, one idea, lighter than LinkedIn.
- **LinkedIn (3000)** — room to tell the story; hook line, whitespace, a takeaway. Longer (300–600 words) is fine *only here*.
- **Instagram (2200)** — caption that works under a visual; front-load the hook.
- **Facebook / YouTube / Pinterest / TikTok** — match the platform's norm and limit.

Honor every hard limit (X 280, Threads 500, Pinterest 800, IG 2200, LinkedIn 3000, TikTok 2200, YouTube 5000, FB 63206) — `schedule_post`/`publish_post` reject anything over. Match each account's recent posts for tone, emoji and hashtag use, and CTA style. Avoid AI tells ("Here's the thing:", "Let me break it down", emoji-heavy openers).

Capture the brief in the campaign brief template if the user wants a record of the repurpose set: `templates/campaign-brief.md` in the `antwork-campaign` skill's folder (in the claude.ai package, `templates/campaign-brief.md`).

## 4. Create as one grouped set

Create every variant in one call:

- `create_campaign(variants=[{account_id, text, hashtags?, goal?}, ...])`, one entry per target account, each with its own copy. Hashtags go in one place: write them in `text`, or pass them in `hashtags` (no `#`) and the server appends them to the text, where they count toward the character limit. Never both. On YouTube `hashtags` are video tags instead.

It returns the `campaign_id` and one post per account, so the set can be tracked, compared and cleaned up together. A variant that fails validation is reported with its reason and the others are still created. Shared media goes in `media_urls` on the same call. Everything is still a DRAFT; nothing is live yet.

## 5. Present, pick, ship

Show the drafts side by side (platform → variant) and let the user edit or drop any before anything goes out. Ask once for the whole set (publish now, schedule, or keep as drafts), not once per variant, unless the user already said. Then per the user's intent:

- **Schedule, staggered**: `schedule_post(post_id, scheduled_for)` (ISO 8601) per variant, spread across the day/week using the preferred times from `get_post_context`'s `workspace` block rather than firing all variants at once. At most 30 days ahead.
- **Schedule, all at one time**: `schedule_post(scheduled_for, campaign_id=...)`.
- **Publish now**: `publish_post(campaign_id=...)`. It publishes the whole set in one call and returns live URLs; report them back, one line per account. Don't call `publish_post` once per variant: each one waits on its platform in turn.

Never claim a variant is "posted" after only `create_post`. Complete the second step.

## 6. Media carries over, but per platform

If the source has an image or video, attach the right asset to each variant with `add_media` and `attach_to_post_ids` (one call can cover several variants): `media_urls=[...]` for library items, `url=...` for a public or AI-generated image. Use `attach_media(post_id, media_urls)` only to set a post's exact list (reorder, remove, clear). One asset that suits every platform can go in `create_campaign`'s `media_urls` instead. Don't assume one aspect ratio fits every platform; flag when a visual needs reformatting for, e.g., Instagram vs. LinkedIn.
